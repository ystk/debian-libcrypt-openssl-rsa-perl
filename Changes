Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA.

0.25  Sun May 20 2007 12:56:11
        - Add a LICENSE file.
        - Fix a bug (reported by many) in rsa.t - we were incorrectly counting
          the number of tests in situations where use_sha512_hash was
          not available.

0.24  Mon Nov 13 2006 08:21:14
        - Fix a bug reported by Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>
          where encrypt could segfault if called with insufficient
          data; it now informatively croaks instead.
        - Fix a bug reported by Mark Martinec where check_key would
          segfault instead of croaking when called on a public key.
        - Fix decrypt and private_encrypt to croak instead of segfault when
          called on a public key.
        - Add an is_private method.
        - Silence a few compiler warnings about ignoring return values
          from certain BIO_* methods.

0.23  Wed Apr 12 2006 00:06:10
        - Provide 32 bytes of seeding in tests, up from 19.
        - Stop relying on implicit includes, which disappeared in the 0.98
          release of OpenSSL.
        - Apply patch from Jim Radford <radford@blackbean.org> to add support
          for SHA{224,256,384,512}

0.22  Mon Nov 15 2005 21:13:20
        - Add public_decrypt, private_encrypt methods, contributed
          by Paul G. Weiss <paul@weiss.name>
        - Some changes to help builds on Redhat9
        - Remove deprecated methods:
          * the no-arg new constructor - use new_from_public_key,
            new_from_private_key or Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->generate_key instead
          * load_public_key - use new_from_public_key
          * load_private_key - use new_from_private_key
          * generate_key as an instance method - use it as a class constructor
            method instead.
          * set_padding_mode - use use_no_padding, use_pkcs1_padding,
            use_pkcs1_oaep_padding, or use_sslv23_padding instead.
          * get_padding_mode
        - Eliminate all(most all) memory leaks.
        - fix email address
        - Stop returning true from methods just to indicate success.
        - Change default public exponent from 65535 to 65537


0.21  Sun Feb 15 2004 21:13:45
        - Include t/format.t in the MANIFEST file, so that it is
          actually included in the distribution.

0.20  Sun Feb 15 2004 15:21:40
        - Finally add support for the public key format produced by
          "openssl rsa -pubout".
        - Add comment in readme about locating kerberos files on redhat systems

0.19  Sun Apr 27 2003 18:33:48
        - Revert back to old declaration style so that we no longer
          break under perl 5.005 (spotted by Rob Brown <bbb@cpan.org>).
        - Add some needed use statements in legacy.t and rsa.t (patch
          submitted by Rob Brown).
        - Fix typo in docs spotted by Daniel Drown <dan@drown.org>
        - Update copyright dates.

0.18  Sun Feb 23 2003 20:44:35
        - Add two new methods, new_key_from_parameters and
          get_key_parameters, which, working with
          Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum, allow working directly with the
          paramaters of an rsa key.

0.17  Mon Jan 06 2003 22:43:31
        - Workaround for gcc 3.2 compile problems:
          "/usr/include/openssl/des.h:193: parse error before '&' token"
          (Patch by Rob Brown <bbb@cpan.org>)
        - Deprecate no-arg constructor, load_*_key methods and the
          instance method generate_key; switch to three constructors:
          new_public_key, new_private_key and generate_key (as a class
          method)
        - Deprecate set_padding_mode method; replace with
          use_xxx_padding.
        - move tests into t directory, use Test as a framework

0.16  Tue Jun 11 22:01:45
        - Fix bug reported by Rob McMillin <rlm@pricegrabber.com> which
          prevented subclassing.

0.15  Fri Jun 07 09:13:12
        - Fix two bugs reported by Gordon Lack <gml4410@ggr.co.uk>: use
          IV, not I32, for pointers, and cast the right-hand, not
          left-hand, value when doing an assignment from an SV to an HV

0.14  Sun May 19 12:35:21
        - Fix bug reported by Charles Jardine <cj10@cam.ac.uk>: use
          Safefree, not free, to release memory allocated by New

0.13  Thu Mar 21 00:10:30
        - Incorporating patch from Matthias Bauer
          <bauerm@immd1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>, which provides
          signing and verification, as well as uses OpenSSL's internal
          error reporting system.  This patch also fixes a bug with the
          RSA_NO_PADDING_MODE.  Thanks, Matthias!
        - Deprecate set_padding_mode in favor of use_xxx_padding.
        - Rather than returning true on success, false on failure, just
          croak when there are problems.
        - Plug memory leaks.
        - Fix my email address (it's cpan.org, not cpan.com)

0.12  Thu Sep 06 22:44:17
        - Fixing bug with Crypt::OpenSSL::Random interoperability
        - Implementing patch from Thomas Linden <scip@daemon.de>
